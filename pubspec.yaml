  assets:
    # Adding a trailing slash (e.g. assets/images/) only includes the files 
    # directly inside that directory. It does NOT include subdirectories 
    # or their contents. 
    #
    # Flutter does not support recursive asset inclusion. If you have 
    # nested directories and want to include their assets as well, you must 
    # list each subdirectory manually.
